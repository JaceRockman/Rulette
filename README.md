A multiplayer mobile game where players create lobbies, add prompts and rules, and spin a wheel to determine game actions. Players earn points for completing prompts and lose points for breaking rules.

## Game Rules

### Point System
- **Starting Points**: 20 per player
- **Prompt Completion**: +2 points
- **Rule Violation**: -1 point
- **Minimum Points**: 0 (cannot go negative)

### Stack Generation
The wheel generates random stacks with this pattern:
1. **Rule** (if available)
2. **Prompt** or **Modifier** (random)
3. **Prompt** or **Modifier** (random, 50% chance)
4. **End**

### Modifiers
- **Double Points**: Next prompt is worth 4 points instead of 2
- **Skip Turn**: Player skips their next turn
- **Reverse Order**: Play order is reversed
- **Free Pass**: Player can skip one rule violation
